Extras
================

The files contained in this folder are extra files and that you may need and want to incorporate them in your theme. 
To use these, simply move them out of the extra folder into your main directory and then add the code needed to make them work.
 
I end up using a lot of these over and over again, but not always, so thought I would put them in here in case. 

If I'm not using them, I just delete them and would recommend you do the same.
 
Let's not pollute servers with excess files.
